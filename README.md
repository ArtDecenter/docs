# ArtDecenter

A market as open as art itself.

## Summary

ArtDecenter is a decentralized application for the art market of tomorrow, focusing on trustworthy interaction between artists, museums and project spaces, collectors and art enthusiasts. By rethinking the structure of ownership and distribution of value, we apply web3 standards to the existing market – easily accessible through the use of our ÐApp powered by the Ethereum blockchain.

## Focusing Ethereum

Most Blockchain projects don't apply something crucial to their business model: reducing the barrier to entry for new adopters. Those companies place their Blockchain projects behind a token-wall, making interaction with their product require at the very least one additional transaction.

ArtDecenter's Blockchain logic runs entirely on top of Ethereum, with no intermediary token. There is no ICO or token-hype involved, as we believe in the strength of Ether as a currency. Additionally, ArtDecenter is completely Open Source. As a part of the Ethereum community we highly value the exchange of information and will contribute to the ongoing development.

This approach results in an easy-to-use product, enabling art market participants to benefit from the advantages of blockchain technology by using a straightforward interface.

## Use-Cases

The ArtDecenter ÐApp isn't limited to a predefined range of functionalities that comes shipped with its download, but instead it's built in a modular approach that is customizable to the users needs. To do so, the ÐApp acts as a hub for different services offered by ArtDecenter, each one covering a specific feature.

**For artists,** services will focus on the distribution of ownership, by empowering the artist to control how equity is distributed. An important addition to current market structures is the ability to receive a cut of upcoming sales, making sure that the artist benefits when an artwork changes ownership.

**For museums & project spaces,** automated payments can be used by museums and project spaces, as details about exhibition participation can be signed as smart contracts. Depending on agreed circumstances, redistribution of entrance fee or tipped token will be programatically distributed to participating artists.

**For art enthusiasts,** interacting with artworks in real life becomes possible by the ability to grab a QR or NFC code with the ÐApp on mobile devices. Once scanned, the user can send a tip to support the artist, receive information about the artworks history or even decide to send an offer to buy a share of equity.

Additionally, authentication is one of the most needed aspects within the current art market, as counterfeit and missing artworks are still present and there is no best practice how to change that. With ArtDecenter, each artwork is linked to a public key that allows to track its owner, location and history.

## Product

The ArtDecenter ÐApp will be developed as a progressive web application (PWA), accessible by desktop browsers and mobile devices. The ÐApp itself is free to use with having access to basic functionalities like wallet transactions and interactions with artworks and artists.
Our business model is to receive a service fee for specific functionalities, that can be added to the core application as needed by the user. Our modular service approach makes it possible to choose what kind of functions to import, with a transparent communication of costs. Payment methods can be chosen individually, whether as a one-time rerouted service fee per transaction or a monthly paid subscription for each service.

## Market

There are two major trends to point out in the current state of the art market: While digital processes gain in becoming part of the art market structure, the opening of local galleries declines. Only 10% of the overall art market transactions are handled online, resulting in a potential field of growth for digital applications. Additionally, this covers only traditional markets like painting and sculpture, but isn't focusing new art forms like digital and VR-based works.
The current situation of trend changing moment and the outlook of new kinds of art forms result in an ideal environment for developing a new infrastructure for the art market of tomorrow.

## Outlook

Beside the listed use-cases above, there are several fields of interest that we are going to do research for:
**Augmented Communication** is a highly valuable field for ArtDecenter, as it extends the way how artworks can be experienced. Since we are planning to work with QR/NFC codes to scan and interact with artworks in real life, the implementation of AR is a logical extension. For example, information about the artworks material or a description of the building process could be accessible through the view of the mobile device, adding another layer of information to the physical artwork.

**Incentive-driven services** as community interactions: As equal distribution of value is a key element of the ArtDecenter platform, we are thinking of active and passive ways of how to support upcoming artists through an self-accelerating process. For example, a protocol that collects a fee of each transaction accumulated per local region, that gets fully redistributed as a bounty campaign with promoted artists elected by its participants. To grow this service, an approval to reroute a fraction of a users transaction fee (to the community-incentive-protocol) results in a reduced pricing for further plugin protocols.

## Hardware extension: Hashframe

Additionally to the ArtDecenter ÐApp we are focusing on building physical devices that simplify the process of interacting with the blockchain. In particular, ArtDecenter is researching a model that displays digital artworks within an offline environment. Similar to as paintings are presented framed, digital artworks will be accessible by our product Hashframe. The display verifies ownership on the blockchain by being linked to the users wallet, making it easy to verify and output the NFTs.  
Additionally to the device, artists and owners of digital artworks will be able to share, lend and rent the keys to display artworks to others via a marketplace service within the ArtDecenter ÐApp.
